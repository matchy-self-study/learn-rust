# Learn Rust

## How to run

To view the output of all examples:

```bash
cargo run
```

To view the output of a specific example:

```bash
cargo run --bin rwea_ch01
```

Note that the files in `src/bin` are all generated by `build.rs` and are not meant to be edited manually.

## Something for me to refer to later
